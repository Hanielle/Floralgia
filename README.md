demo website  
Website done back in 9th grade for a joint Biology and Computer Science project   
About the parts of a plant cell and different plant tissues  
Pretty much an educational website, done using javascript, css, and html  
Works best in chrome and preferably a monitor  
Mobile responsive, though not all screen sizes (due to time restriction when coded)
